The multi-modal sentiment analysis provides a method to carry out opinion analysis based on the combination of video, audio, and text.[1]This paper presents a method for multimodal sentiment classification, which can identify the sentiment expression. Using a new multimodal dataset consisting of sentiment-annotated utterances extracted from video reviews, we show that multimodal sentiment analysis can be effectively performed.This analysis helps to classify the polarity (Positive, Negative, and Neutral) of the individuals and it needs the involvement of human-machine interaction. Data preprocessing, feature extraction, training, and sentiment classifications based on the machine learning approaches are used in this modal.
